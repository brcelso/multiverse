TLOU DualShock = $84,99 - 14-03-2025

Alongside the reveal of the PlayStation 5’s $399
 and $499 price tags and November 12th release 
date, Sony also announced how much the various
 accessories for the upcoming console will cost.

The most important price is that of Sony’s 
new DualSense controller, which will cost $69.99 
for additional gamepads. 
That’s a $10 increase compared to the $59.99 
MSRP for the DualShock 4 — apparently all 
the fancy haptic feedback technology and 
adaptive triggers that Sony is adding don’t 
come cheap. And the charging station, which 
can recharge two DualSense controllers at once, 
is set to cost $29.99.


Meanwhile, the Pulse 3D wireless headset — 
which will support Sony’s big push for 3D audio
 — is set to cost $99.99, while the PlayStation
 5’s media remote will cost $29.99.

Lastly, the HD Camera, which features dual 
1080p lenses and allows for players to 
broadcast themselves alongside streamed 
gameplay directly from the PlayStation 5, 
is set to cost $59.99. 

Despite no public announcement from the company, 
myriad retailers including Sony's own PlayStation 
Direct increased the price of all DualSense 
colorways by $5 today, September 9, 2024. 
Target, Best Buy, and Amazon all saw the price 
rise too.

The standard DualSense in White, Starlight Blue, 
Galactic Purple, Cosmic Red, Midnight Black, 
and Gray Camouflage now costs $74.99 instead 
of $69.99, while the more expensive colors 
including Sterling Silver, Cobalt Blue, 
and Volcanic Red have increased to $79.99 
from $74.99.

Controllers Revealed | 
State of Play September 2023
The price increase has been seen elsewhere 
in the world too, including with a £5 increase
 in the UK and a $10 increase in Australia. 
No price increase for the PS5 console itself 
has been applied or announced.

The controller bump comes two weeks after 
Sony steeply increased the price of the 
PS5 in Japan and seemingly on the verge of 
an official PlayStation 5 Pro announcement.
